## Churn Prediction Deep Learning Model

# Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to predict customer churn, helping businesses understand and mitigate the risk of losing customers. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies patterns and factors contributing to churn.

# Features
Dataset: Load the Dataset from kaggle
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for training.
Deep Learning Model: Implemented using [TensorFlow/Keras] for accurate predictions.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics to assess the model's effectiveness.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.

# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 0.7975 on the test dataset, demonstrating its potential for effective churn prediction.
